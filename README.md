# cafe_and_api

In this project, I worked on sql tables using SqlAlchemy. I have coded adding, removing, updating and deleting data in tables. I also learned to create my own APIs using the Postman app. I did not use templates in the project. Because my main goal was to learn and understand how databases work.
